## Query

```sql
SELECT
   oi.ORDER_ID,
   sum(oi.QUANTITY) as TOTAL_ITEMS,
   ss.STATUS_DATE,
   f.FACILITY_ID,
   f.FACILITY_TYPE_ID
FROM order_header oh
INNER JOIN order_item oi
ON oi.ORDER_ID =  oh.ORDER_ID
INNER JOIN order_shipment os
ON os.ORDER_ID = oi.ORDER_ID AND os.ORDER_ITEM_SEQ_ID = oi.ORDER_ITEM_SEQ_ID
INNER JOIN shipment s
ON s.SHIPMENT_ID = os.SHIPMENT_ID
INNER JOIN shipment_status ss
ON s.SHIPMENT_ID = ss.SHIPMENT_ID
INNER JOIN facility f
ON f.FACILITY_ID = s.ORIGIN_FACILITY_ID
WHERE ss.STATUS_ID = "SHIPMENT_SHIPPED"
AND ss.STATUS_DATE >= date_sub(current_date(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
AND f.FACILITY_TYPE_ID= "WAREHOUSE"
GROUP BY oi.ORDER_ID
HAVING sum(oi.QUANTITY)=1;
